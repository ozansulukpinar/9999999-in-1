# SOLID

They are the design principles that enable us manage most of software design problems. It is an acroynm for five desing principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintable. Subset of many principles by Robert C. Martin:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

What will be happened if SOLID principles are not using during coding:

- code which is not testable
- duplication of code
- new bugs by fixing another bug
- many unknown issues in the application development cycle

If we use:

- reduction in complexity of code
- increase readability, extensibility and maintenance
- reduce error and implement reusability
- better testability
